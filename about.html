                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Hello, My name is Flavian. This is my first atempt of creating a website and a game.
                   Therefore, I have created the website throuth HTML language and in order to create the
                   design of it I have used CSS which was really interesting. The game is done through Java
                   Script html and CSS.
                   Thank you very much, have a good day!  
                </p>
