                <h1>Storyline</h1>
                <p>In this section I am going to talk about the storyline for my text adventure game. The action 
                    of my text adventure game is going to be split in two parts one is going to take place in
                    Romania after the second World War in a city called Bran where long time ago use to live
                    Dracula. In fact, in this location we can find the Dracula’s Castle which is very famous around 
                    the world. And the second part is going to take place in Russia in Moscow. The main 
                    character of my storyline is called Vlad who has 23 years old. A brave teenager who wants 
                    to build a name in this little town and not only as he is not enough satisfied how people 
                    recognise him after the war. His life was a chaotic one because he lost both of his parents
                    during the second World War. His character is quite harsh, a teenager who suffered a lot but 
                    who can hide all the suffer and hate. The life and the pressure situations that he went 
                    through though to him how to be calm and find the right way in order to cope with the
                    difficult situation. He doesn’t like to talk too much he likes to go straight to the point. During 
                    the second world war he manage to earn a lot of medals as he was able to complete all the 
                    given missions successfully. After the second World War he was not enough satisfied
                    considering that he lost all the members of his family, even if he managed to win a lot of 
                    medals during this time. He wanted that the people would recognise him as a hero but in 
                    front of them he has nothing special probably because of his background his family was 
                    extremely poor and nobody had a little respect to him and his family that is the main reason 
                    why he wish to change this aspect so much and being seen by other in a different way.
                    One day, after two years when he came back in town, he has received a letter from his 
                    commander where the commander is thanking him for the good work that he has done in 
                    the war. Furthermore, the commander is having a special mission for him in case if he wants 
                    to accept it. The mission consists in finding the Romanian Treasure which basically is a 
                    collection of many different items, jewels in gold and gold reserves here we are talking 
                    about full waggons of gold that belong of the Romania government that has been sent in 
                    Russia for safekeeping and which never been returned. From this letter Vlad understood 
                    that this is his big opportunity to show not only to the people of his town who is him but 
                    also to the entire nation. Therefore, in the end he accepted the mission and next day he 
                    went to meet the commander for further details.
                    When he arrived next day to meet the commander. The commander started to go in details 
                    regarding the treasure. Consequently, from the resources that the commander received the 
                    treasure is located near Moscow in Russia and that this is an extremely hard mission 
                    because usually all the best soldier that the commander sent there in order to get more 
                    information regarding the treasure no one managed to came back so the commander told 
                    him to pay attention at any details as he is going to be a spy in Moscow and being able to
                    find precise information with the exact location of the treasure. Once Vlad manage to 
                    identify the treasure and provide enough evidence for the portfolio that the commander
                    has, the commander will be able to request the treasure from the Russia government as is 
                    written in the contract.3
                    In conclusion Vlad will go to Russia in Moscow and face different challenges in order to be 
                    able to find the tressure and provide the evidence required which allows the commander to 
                    request back the treasure. He will meet Alexandra and work together.
